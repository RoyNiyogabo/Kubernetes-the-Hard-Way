### What are Kubeconfigs and Why Do We Need Them?

In this section, we will be generating kubeconfigs which will be used later to set up a Kubernetes cluster. Before proceeding, however, it is a good idea to have some basic understanding of what kubeconfigs are, and what purpose they serve. This lesson introduces you to kubeconfigs and provides some background on what they do and why they are needed. After completing this lesson, you will have an idea of how kubeconfigs are used, which will prepare you for the task of creating them.

You can find more information on kubeconfigs in the official Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/
