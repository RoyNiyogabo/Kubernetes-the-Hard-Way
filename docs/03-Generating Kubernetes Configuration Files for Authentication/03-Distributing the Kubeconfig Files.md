Now that we have generated the kubeconfig files that we will need in order to configure our Kubernetes cluster, we need to make sure that each cloud server has a copy of the kubeconfig files that it will need. In this lesson, we will distribute the kubeconfig files to each of the worker and controller nodes so that they will be in place for future lessons. After completing this lesson, each of your worker and controller nodes should have a copy of the kubeconfig files it needs.

Here are the commands used in the demo. Be sure to replace the placeholders with the actual values from your cloud servers.

Move kubeconfig files to the worker nodes:
```
scp <worker 1 hostname>.kubeconfig kube-proxy.kubeconfig user@<worker 1 public IP>:~/
scp <worker 2 hostname>.kubeconfig kube-proxy.kubeconfig user@<worker 2 public IP>:~/
```

Move kubeconfig files to the controller nodes:
```
scp admin.kubeconfig kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig kube-scheduler.kubeconfig user@<controller 1 public IP>:~/
scp admin.kubeconfig kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig kube-scheduler.kubeconfig user@<controller 2 public IP>:~/
```
