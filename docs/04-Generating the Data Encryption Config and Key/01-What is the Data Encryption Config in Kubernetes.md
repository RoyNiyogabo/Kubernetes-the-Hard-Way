## What is the Data Encryption Config in Kubernetes?

One important security practice is to ensure that sensitive data is never stored in plain text. Kubernetes offers the ability to encrypt sensitive data when it is stored. However, in order to use this feature it is necessary to provide Kubernetes with a data encrpytion config containing an encryption key. This lesson briefly discusses what the data encrpytion config is and why it is needed. This will provide you with some background knowledge as you proceed to create a data encrpytion config for your cluster. After completing this lesson, you will have a basic understanding of what a data encrpytion config is and what it is used for.


You can find more information on data encrpytion in Kubernetes in the official docs:
