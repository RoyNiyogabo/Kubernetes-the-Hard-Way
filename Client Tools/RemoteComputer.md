In order to proceed with Kubernetes the Hard Way, there are some client tools that you need to install on your local workstation. These include cfssl and kubectl. This lesson introduces these tools and guides you through the process of installing them. After completing this lesson, you should have cfssl and kubectl installed correctly on your workstation.
You can find more information on how to install these tools, as well as instructions for OS X/Linux, here: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/02-client-tools.md

Commands used in the demo to install the client tools in a Linux environment:

### cfssl:
```
wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64 \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
chmod +x cfssl_linux-amd64 cfssljson_linux-amd64
sudo mv cfssl_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
sudo mv cfssljson_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
cfssl version
```

### If you want to work on an i386 machine, use these commands to install cfssl instead:
  ```
  wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
    https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-386 \
    https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-386
  chmod +x cfssl_linux-386 cfssljson_linux-386
  sudo mv cfssl_linux-386 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
  sudo mv cfssljson_linux-386 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
  cfssl version
  ```
### kubectl:
  wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
  
  chmod +x kubectl
  sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
  kubectl version --client
